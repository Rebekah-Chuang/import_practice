```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

-   Read in the Excel file called `sales.xlsx` from the `data-raw/` folder such that it looks like the following.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sales-1.png")
```

```{r left-result}
sales_left <- read_excel("data-raw/sales.xlsx",
                         col_names = c("id", "n"))
sales_left <- sales_left[5:13,]
sales_left
```

-   **Stretch goal:** Manipulate the sales data such such that it looks like the following.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sales-2.png")
```
```{r right-result}
sales_right <- sales_left %>% 
  mutate(
    brand = case_when(
      id %in% c("1234", "8721", "1822") ~ "Brand 1",
      id %in% c("3333", "2156", "3987", "3216") ~ "Brand 2"),
    id = as.double(id),
    n = as.double(n)
  )

sales_right <- sales_right[, c("brand", "id", "n")] %>% 
  na.omit(sales_right)
sales_right
```
